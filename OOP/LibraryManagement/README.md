Library Management System
Summary

Create a simple application that simulates a basic library lending service.
The system allows users to browse available books, borrow a book, and return it.

Requirements

The application should include:

A Book class with attributes such as title, author, year, and an availability status.

A method to display available books and filter them based on attributes (title, author, year).

Implement a system to handle borrowing a book, updating its availability.

Allow users to return books, updating the system to make them available again.

Testing Requirements

Write comprehensive tests for your implementation.

Cover edge cases such as:

Borrowing an already borrowed book.

Returning a book that was never borrowed.

Looking up books that do not exist in the library.

Achieve at least 90% code coverage.
