Goal

Build a command-line app that accepts commands, maintains a roverâ€™s state on a 2D plane, and updates/prints its position and heading.

# Should be able to move
# Should be able to change directions its facing
# Should have a display command for showing the possible commands
# Should not crash on unknown commands and be reliable to continue running as much as possible because we dont want the rover to die.
