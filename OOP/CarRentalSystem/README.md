// Car Rental System
// Summary

// Create a simple application that simulates a basic car rental service.
// The system allows users to browse available cars, rent a car, and return it.
// Requirements
// The application should include:
// A Car class with attributes such as make, model, year, and availability status.
// A method to display available cars for rent and filter them based on attributes.
// Implement a system to handle renting a car, updating its availability.
// Allow users to return cars, updating the system to make the car available for others.
// Testing Requirements
// Write comprehensive tests for your implementation.
// Test edge cases like renting an already rented car and errors in returning cars.
// Achieve at least 90% code coverage.
