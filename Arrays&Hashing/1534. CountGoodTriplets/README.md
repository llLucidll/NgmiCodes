**Approach**

In this problem, a classic bruteforce solution is employed. Perhaps one day I will optimize it to something better?

1. Use three for loops for finding the three triplets.
2. Employ the constraints as required by the question
3. If a good triplet is found increment our counter

Time: O(n^3) three for loops

Space: O(1)
