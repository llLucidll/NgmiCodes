**Approach**



1. First we check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. If we we append FizzBuzz
2. Else if we check for 3 and else if we check for 5. If neither we just append the string of the number



Time: O(n) Goes through the entire list once



Space: O(n) We store n characters where n is the input number
